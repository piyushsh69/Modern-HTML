            <h2>1. Audio and Video Support</h2>
            <p>HTML5 introduced native support for embedding audio and video content. This allows you to include
                multimedia elements directly in your web pages without relying on third-party plugins like Flash. It
                enhances the user experience and accessibility.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Canvas for Graphics</h2>
            <p>The &lt;canvas&gt; element in HTML5 provides a versatile way to render graphics, charts, animations, and
                games directly in the browser using JavaScript. It allows for dynamic and interactive visual content on
                your website.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Improved Forms</h2>
            <p>HTML5 brings new input types (e.g., email, url, date, number) and attributes (e.g., placeholder,
                required) that enhance the functionality and validation of web forms. This makes it easier to create
                user-friendly and robust forms for data collection.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Geolocation</h2>
            <p>HTML5 allows websites to access a user's geographical location through the Geolocation API. This feature
                is useful for location-based services, mapping, and personalized content delivery.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Local Storage</h2>
            <p>The Local Storage API in HTML5 enables web applications to store data locally in a user's browser. This
                can be used for caching, offline access, and maintaining user preferences.</p>
