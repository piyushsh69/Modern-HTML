1. Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, and more. These elements help define the structure and meaning of web content, making it more accessible and search engine-friendly.

2. Audio and Video: HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content using the <audio> and <video> elements. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

3. Canvas: The <canvas> element allows for dynamic rendering of graphics, charts, animations, and games directly in the browser, using JavaScript.

4. Improved Forms: HTML5 introduced new input types (e.g., email, url, date, number) and attributes (e.g., placeholder, required) that enhance the functionality and validation of web forms.

5. Geolocation: HTML5 provides an API for accessing the user's geographical location, enabling location-based web applications.

6. Local Storage: The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs allow web applications to store data locally in the browser, improving performance and offline capabilities.

7. Web Workers: Web Workers enable multi-threading in JavaScript, allowing complex tasks to run in the background without affecting the main UI thread, leading to improved performance.

8. WebSockets: HTML5 introduced the WebSocket API, enabling real-time communication between the client and server, making it ideal for applications that require instant data updates.

9. Responsive Web Design: HTML5 is designed with mobile devices in mind and provides features like media queries and flexible layouts to create responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

10. Drag and Drop: HTML5 includes support for drag-and-drop interactions, making it easier to implement user-friendly interfaces for tasks like file uploads.

11. Offline Application Cache: The Application Cache (AppCache) allows web developers to specify which files should be cached by the browser, enabling web applications to work offline.

12. Improved Accessibility: HTML5 includes new elements and attributes that enhance web accessibility, making it easier to create websites that are usable by people with disabilities.

13. SVG Support: HTML5 has better integration with Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), allowing for the creation of vector graphics directly in web pages.

14. Custom Data Attributes: Developers can add custom data attributes (prefixed with data-) to HTML elements, which can be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript for various purposes.

15. Web Storage: HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs for storing data on the client-side, providing a more efficient alternative to using cookies.

These are just some of the many features that HTML5 brought to web development, making it a more powerful and versatile platform for building modern web applications.
